# python-challenge

Many thanks to my friend, Rocky Green and my tutor, Saad Khan for the assistance on this challenge. 

# PyBank

Thank you to Rocky Green for the assist on the logic polishing for increase/decrease.
Thank you to Saad Khan for the guidance on average change.

PyBank script takes bank profit and loss data and provides: 
    the total range for the data, 
    the total profit over that range, 
    the average change, 
    biggest increase and decrease, 
    as well as the dates for those events. 

A text file with the results is also generated. 

# PyPoll

PyPoll takes data from an election and provides:
    the total votes cast,
    the totals and percentages for each candidate, 
    and the winner of the election.

PyPoll only needs the "candidateX_name" variables filled in to match those of canidates in election data files.
